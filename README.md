<h1>CSS Property Alphabetiser</h1>
<p>This was my first project so I am sure there are loads of things that could be improved so if anyone has any useful tips/suggestions etc. on how to improve the code are always greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>Basic functionality where you type or paste the CSS code into the first box, hit Submit and it will go though all the text and alphabetically sort the properties wihtin each rule.</p>
<p>This takes into account media queries, variables and prefixed properties.</p>

</ul>
